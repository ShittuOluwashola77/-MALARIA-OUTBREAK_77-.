Malaria continues to be a significant cause of death in Nigeria, affecting individuals of all ages, from children to adults. The outbreak of malaria is influenced by various factors, including temperature, humidity, stagnant water, and an unkempt environment.

I presented a comprehensive dashboard on the prevalence of malaria outbreaks in Nigeria. The first visualization on the left side of your screen indicates that malaria outbreaks are more common in rural areas compared to urban areas. In the rural regions, we recorded 50.6% of malaria outbreaks, whereas urban regions accounted for 49.4%. This data strongly suggests that malaria is more prevalent in rural areas, even though it impacts both urban and rural populations alike.

The second visualization illustrates the relationship between humidity and malaria outbreaks. A significant 50.3% of respondents indicated that high humidity is a factor contributing to malaria, while 49.97% believe that low humidity also plays a role. This reinforces the conclusion that humidity is a primary driver of malaria outbreaks.

The third visualization highlights water quality access among respondents. Here, 50.54% confirmed their access to good water, while 49.46% reported accessing poor-quality water. 

In the fourth visualization, we analyzed malaria outbreaks by mosquito species. The data shows that Culex Quinquiefaciatus comprises 33.16%, Anopheles gambiae represents 33.26%, and Aedes Aegypti accounts for 33.57%. All these species are significant carriers of malaria.

The fifth visualization indicates that 50.17% of respondents acknowledged the presence of stagnant water in their surroundings, while 49.83% claimed there was no stagnant water. This reinforces the understanding that stagnant water is a crucial factor in the outbreak of malaria.

Finally, the sixth visualization reveals that 50.57% of respondents have vegetation in their environment, while 49.43% do not. This correlation confirms that the presence of vegetation in an area with stagnant water or where people live contributes to the occurrence of malaria outbreaks.

In conclusion, while percentages show slight variations, the overwhelming trends in this data underscore the critical factors driving malaria outbreaks in Nigeria.
